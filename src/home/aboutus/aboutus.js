  `UniCS is the University of Manchester's tech society. We are a big
  community of people with a passion for technology and creating innovative
  solutions for everyone to enjoy. Through our hackathons and other events, we
  aim to bring students and industry closer together. When we aren’t
  organising our own events we also travel to events in places like Barcelona,
  Helsinki, and Bordeaux, amongst other exotic destinations, often free due to
  various hackathon sponsors. Come join us to see what we get up to this year!`,

  `Our own events are suited to every level of knowledge and all degree
  courses. If you are someone who is interested in knowing how they can use
  computers to see an idea come to life, UniCS is the society for you. It
  doesn’t matter if you have never touched a computer or been programming
  for years, you will never be bored at our events. And if you still aren’t
  convinced, we have free pizza (and occasionally drinks).`,
